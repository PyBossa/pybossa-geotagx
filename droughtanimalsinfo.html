		<h3>What is this about?</h3> 
		<p>
        <strong>This module investigates how we could extract information on the effects of drought on animals.</p>
		 <p>
        The icon image, and images within this module, come from <a href="http://www.faoswalim.org/">FAO SWALIM</a> on <a href="https://secure.flickr.com/photos/faoswalim/sets/72157642992734333/">Flickr</a></p>
        </p>	
        <p> Please <a href="https://github.com/geotagx/pybossa/issues">share your feedback</a> on the modules in this project. </p>
		<p>We want to answer questions like: <ul><li>What animals are found in the area?</li><li>What condition are they in? Are the healthy?</li><li>Are they alive or dead?</li></ul></p>
		
		<h3>How does it work?</h3> 
		<p>You will be presented with an image from drought in Somalia and asked a series of questions about what you see in the photo.</p>
		<p>You can <strong><a href="http://geotagx.org/app/animals_tutorial/newtask"></strong>taking the tutorial</a></strong> before starting so you know what to look for.</p>
		<p>You can click on <strong>"Get some help"</strong> for each question for help.</p>
		<p><strong>Don't worry if you are not sure about your answer</strong>, each photo is presented to at least 30 people and the final answers are taken from the majority response. </p>
		<p><strong>If you can't see what is in the photo</strong> select "I don't know" - this is a good answer!</p>
		<p><strong>Don't worry if several photos seem irrelevant</strong>, sometimes you might click through several photos before finding one you can analyse. The same photos are presented in multiple modules on topics scuh as agriculture, soil and water. While a photo may not be relevant for this analysis, it may be relevant to another.</p>		
		<p>If you want more information on what sort of data is collected before, during, and after a disaster, have a look at the <a href="https://scms.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/1866/fog_v4.pdf">Field Operations Guide for Disaster Assessment and Response</a> produced by <a href="http://www.usaid.gov/">USAID</a></p>

		<h3>What are we doing with the results?</h3> 
		<p>
        Results will help us improve this module and others like it so that they could be deployed during a real drought or other disaster situations.</p>
		<p>More generally we will also use these results to determine how these types of applications could be best used in a disaster situation.
