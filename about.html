<h2> GeoTag-X </h2>
GeoTag-X is an open-source, crowdsourcing project, for generating information from media about disasters. It is part of <a href="http://http://citizencyberlab.eu/">Citizen Cyberlab</a>, built with <a href=”http://pybossa.com/”>PyBossa</a> and hosted by <a href="http://www.unitar.org/unosat/">UNITAR-UNOSAT</a>.
<br>
<h2> Participate </h2>
The project is open for participation (from mid-2014) but is still experimental; volunteers can now <a href="http://geotagx.org/find_photos">find photos</a> or <a href="http://geotagx.org/analyse_photos">analyse photos</a>. We also welcome collaborators for new  GeoTag-X projects, such as organisations or researchers addressing a particular crisis. You could propose a new project <a href=”https://github.com/geotagx/pybossa/issues”>in the repository</a>, or <a href="mailto:cobi.smith@unitar.org?Subject=geotagx">
by email</a>.
<br>
<h2> Feedback</h2>
We welcome volunteers and we encourage you to report bugs and suggest enhancements on <a href=”https://github.com/geotagx/pybossa/issues”>GitHub</a>, or without logging in <a href="https://etherpad.mozilla.org/geotagx">on Etherpad</a>, or <a href="http://citizencyberlab.eu/portfolio-type/events/">participate in a live event</a>. GeoTag-X involves collaborative learning and developing a community practice. New collaborations are welcome, as well as new individual participants.
<br>
<h2> Context </h2>
The name GeoTag-X was chosen as it expresses key components of the system: <ol>
<li>Geo: all media should be georeferenced as accurately as possible;</li>
<li>Tag: all media should have data tags relevant to the humanitarian and disaster response community, compatible with existing disaster response methodologies;</li>
<li>X: the system should be adaptable for diverse disaster situations anywhere. For example a flood in Bangladesh can occur at the same time as a flood in Sudan and we want GeoTag-X modules to support humanitarian responses for each event.</li>
</ol>
The project aims to contrbute information for humanitarian disaster responses, reflected in recent UNOCHA recommendations:
<br>
<q>By increasing the use of open data platforms, information sharing and organizational transparency humanitarian organizations can model best practices and prioritize resources to protecting only the most sensitive information... investigate ways to engage with
online communities and other groups to promote the idea of a “humanitarian cyberspace” and to encourage recognition of humanitarian principles.</q>
<br>(<a href="https://docs.unocha.org/sites/dms/Documents/Humanitarianism%20in%20the%20Cyberwarfare%20Age%20-%20OCHA%20Policy%20Paper%2011.pdf">UNOCHA 2014 policy brief</a>, pages 18-19)
<br><br>
During disasters, first responders and emergency services deal with massive amounts of data. Disasters include sudden events such as earthquakes, floods, and hurricanes, as well as long-term events such as drought, climate change and pollution. Crowdsourcing has already been used during disaster events to help filter, categorise, and map data and has <a href=”https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wut8oDRo9BYSlc0hQ34Ng8qQ-pLVGlRO95WOvR3MN78/edit?hl=en_US”>proved invaluable</a>, though <a href=”http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/clay.westrope-28042014-065633-PHL_OSM-Damage-Assessment_Final-Report_To-submit.pdf”>challenges remain</a>. This is why GeoTag-X is a <a href=”http://citizencyberlab.eu/research/publications-and-reports/”>research project</a>, as well as a humanitarian technology project.
